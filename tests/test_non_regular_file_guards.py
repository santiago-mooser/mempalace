"""Non-regular files must never wedge an ingest command.

``os.walk``/``rglob`` list a FIFO, a socket and a device node as ordinary
filenames, and MemPalace decides what to read by extension. Opening a FIFO
for reading parks in the kernel until a writer appears, so a named pipe
called ``notes.md`` sitting in a mined directory used to hang ``mine``,
``sweep`` and ``init`` forever — no output, no error, no progress.

Every check that could block is bounded by a deadline; the handful that only
touch a regular file or a missing path are not, because they have nothing to
block on. A regression must turn this file red; it must not
hang the suite (an unbounded blocking open would otherwise stall pytest
itself, which reports as "still running", not as a failure).
:func:`hard_timeout` is that deadline wherever the block would happen in a
call Python makes. Where it happens inside a C library that restarts the
syscall itself, :func:`_repair_status_bounded` and
:func:`_integrity_probe_bounded` run the call in a child process instead, for
the reason the second one's docstring records.
