"""
logstream.py — Agent coordination event log for MemPalace (RFC 003)
===================================================================

A small append-only event layer stored in the active palace directory as
``logstream.sqlite3``. Agents use it to delegate work, wait for replies,
and exchange exact patch/file artifacts through the shared MemPalace hub
without a human relaying messages between machines.

Design constraints (RFC 003):

- No Chroma dependency, no vector index open — plain SQLite only.
- Append-only: events are immutable; corrections are new events that
  reference prior events (see :meth:`Logstream.ack_event`).
- Exact payloads: event bodies and artifact content are stored verbatim.
- Safe under concurrent HTTP requests (WAL + per-instance lock, same
  pattern as ``knowledge_graph.py``).
- Explicit size limits with clear errors, never silent truncation.

Usage:
    from mempalace.logstream import Logstream

    ls = Logstream(db_path="/path/to/palace/logstream.sqlite3")
    evt = ls.append_event(
        type="task.request", stream="project/mempalace", room="delegation",
        from_agent="mac-codex", to_agent="windows-codex",
        correlation_id="task_123", body="Please fix search echo ranking.",
    )
    reply = ls.wait_events(correlation_id="task_123", type="patch.ready",
                           timeout_ms=300_000)

# ``list_events`` filters are single-valued and positive-only, because they
# map straight onto indexed SQL equality. A watcher needs two things that
# shape cannot express:
#
#   * "wake me for task.request OR patch.ready" — several values per field
#   * "everything addressed to me EXCEPT my own broadcasts" — a negation
#
# The second is not a nicety. ``to_agent=<me>`` deliberately also matches
# broadcast events (``to_agent='*'``), and an agent's own broadcasts are
# broadcasts — so a naive watcher wakes itself every time it posts a status.
#
# Watch therefore pushes down whatever single-valued filters it can (keeping
# the SQL selective) and applies the multi-valued and negative parts here.
