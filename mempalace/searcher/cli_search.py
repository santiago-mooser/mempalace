    still ranks by BM25, so dropping the filter would rank a diverged
    palace by different rules than a healthy one.

    An active ``[since_dt, before_dt)`` window is forwarded to the BM25
    reader, which post-filters on it. A diverged index degrades the
    ranking; it must never widen the result set past the window the
